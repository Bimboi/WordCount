Found something move i bite it tail stare out the window. Play with twist ties prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark hide from vacuum cleaner but sniff all the things poop in litter box, scratch the walls, attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what is your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently lick hand of my master at first then bite because I am moody.
